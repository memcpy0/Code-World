During the The British Library project, I was responsible for several key tasks. But Here I want to introduce the function of returning books by scanning codes. 

To demonstrate the functio we need to log in to the staff account. Enter the name and password to log in to the staff01 account, and then enter the book borrowing record function page. Note that it prompts which books need to be returned and which book's fine need to be paid. In order to return books by scanning codes, click on the "Return Book by Scan Code" button above. This function is added for staff to quickly operate when returning books in front of the user.

Of course, this is just a simulation of scanning codes, not a real scan. We scan the barcode of the book, and the scanned result is a string, which we use as the borrowId. Assuming the value scanned from the barcode of this book is Sixty Nine, here will be Sixty Nine, and then we click "return" to complete the book return process.

That's all I want to show. Actually, I am proud of works I have done on this project as a backend software developer. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on such an exciting project. Thank you for considering my jobs. Now My introduction is over.
