There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

 
**Example 1:**
```cpp
Input: 
first = "pale"
second = "ple"
Output: True
```
**Example 2:**
```cpp
Input: 
first = "pales"
second = "pal"
Output: False
```
