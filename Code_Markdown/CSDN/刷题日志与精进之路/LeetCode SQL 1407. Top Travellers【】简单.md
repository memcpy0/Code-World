Table: `Users`

```haskell
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
name is the name of the user.
```

Table: `Rides`

```haskell
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who travelled the distance "distance".
```

 

Write an SQL query to report the distance travelled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by `travelled_distance` in **descending order**, if two or more users travelled the same distance, order them by their `name` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

  
```haskell
Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+

Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Elvis and Lee travelled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveller as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald didn't have any rides, the distance travelled by him is 0.
```
题意：写一段 SQL , 报告每个用户的旅行距离。返回的结果表单,  以 `travelled_distance` 降序排列，如果有两个或者更多的用户旅行了相同的距离，那么再以 `name` 升序排列。
