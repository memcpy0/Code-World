# 二、有向图 Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph
有向图判断环的存在要复杂一些。一个算法就是[拓扑排序]() 。


2.利用改进的DFS

对于有向图的话，如果直接应用一般的DFS的话，会出现误判的情况，一个典型的例子是：A->B,A->C->B,我们用DFS来处理这个图，我们会得出它有环，但实际上并没有。然而，本文中所说的无向图的DFS判断算法完全可以直接应用到有向图中来，即上述代码可以直接应用到有向图中来。所以说上述的DFS算法(或称为为改进的DFS算法)既适用于无向图，也适用于有向图。其对应的原理适用于这两种图，即只要我们在遍历过程中，只要发现一个顶点不是当前节点的父节点，同时他还被访问过了(状态为1)，那么就可以认为此处存在环。(通常在DFS中一个顶点的未被访问的邻接点，相当于生成树中的该顶点的子孙节点)

Solution using Depth First Search or DFS

    Approach: Depth First Traversal can be used to detect a cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestors in the tree produced by DFS. In the following graph, there are 3 back edges, marked with a cross sign. We can observe that these 3 back edges indicate 3 cycles present in the graph.

    To detect a back edge, keep track of vertices currently in the recursion stack of function for DFS traversal. If a vertex is reached that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree. The edge that connects the current vertex to the vertex in the recursion stack is a back edge. Use recStack[] array to keep track of vertices in the recursion stack.

    Dry run of the above approach:
    Algorithm:
        Create the graph using the given number of edges and vertices.
        Create a recursive function that initializes the current index or vertex, visited, and recursion stack.
        Mark the current node as visited and also mark the index in recursion stack.
        Find all the vertices which are not visited and are adjacent to the current node. Recursively call the function for those vertices, If the recursive function returns true, return true.
        If the adjacent vertices are already marked in the recursion stack then return true.
        Create a wrapper class, that calls the recursive function for all the vertices and if any function returns true return true. Else if for all vertices the function returns false return false.

###  Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph using BFS
28-11-2018

Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not. Your function should return true if the given graph contains at least one cycle, else return false. For example, the following graph contains two cycles 0->1->2->3->0 and 2->4->2, so your function must return true.

We have discussed a DFS based solution to detect cycle in a directed graph. In this post, BFS based solution is discussed.

The idea is to simply use Kahn’s algorithm for Topological Sorting

Steps involved in detecting cycle in a directed graph using BFS.


Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the graph and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.

    Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
    Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
    If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.

Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.

Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph has cycle, otherwise not.

How to find in-degree of each node?
There are 2 ways to calculate in-degree of every vertex:
Take an in-degree array which will keep track of
1) Traverse the array of edges and simply increase the counter of the destination node by 1.

for each node in Nodes
    indegree[node] = 0;
for each edge(src,dest) in Edges
    indegree[dest]++

Time Complexity: O(V+E)

2) Traverse the list for every node and then increment the in-degree of all the nodes connected to it by 1.

    for each node in Nodes
        If (list[node].size()!=0) then
        for each dest in list
            indegree[dest]++;

Time Complexity: The outer for loop will be executed V number of times and the inner for loop will be executed E number of times, Thus overall time complexity is O(V+E).

The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(V+E)

## Detect Cycle in a directed graph using colors
12-03-2016

Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not. Your function should return true if the given graph contains at least one cycle, else return false.

Solution

Approach: Depth First Traversal can be used to detect cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (selfloop) or one of its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS. In the following graph, there are 3 back edges, marked with cross sign. It can be observed that these 3 back edges indicate 3 cycles present in the graph.


For a disconnected graph, we get the DFS forest as output. To detect cycle, we can check for cycle in individual trees by checking back edges.

In the previous post, we have discussed a solution that stores visited vertices in a separate array which stores vertices of the current recursion call stack.

In this post, a different solution is discussed. The solution is from CLRS book. The idea is to do DFS of a given graph and while doing traversal, assign one of the below three colours to every vertex.

    WHITE : Vertex is not processed yet. Initially, all vertices are WHITE.

    GRAY: Vertex is being processed (DFS for this vertex has started, but not finished which means that all descendants (in DFS tree) of this vertex are not processed yet (or this vertex is in the function call stack)

    BLACK : Vertex and all its descendants are processed. While doing DFS, if an edge is encountered from current vertex to a GRAY vertex, then this edge is back edge and hence there is a cycle.


Algorithm:

    Create a recursive function that takes the edge and color array (this can be also kept as a global variable)
    Mark the current node as GREY.
    Traverse all the adjacent nodes and if any node is marked GREY then return true as a loop is bound to exist.
    If any adjacent vertex is WHITE then call the recursive function for that node. If the function returns true. Return true.
    If no adjacent node is grey or has not returned true then mark the current Node as BLACK and return false.

Implementation:
